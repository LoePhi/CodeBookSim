The goal for this project is to virtually assemble logic gates (AND, OR, ...) into a working microprocessor.

The projects closely follows the ideas laid out in Charles Petzold's Book [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software).
